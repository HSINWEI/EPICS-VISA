/** @mainpage VISAdrv (EPICS ASYN driver for National Instruments VISA)

VISAdrv is an <A HREF="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</A> support module allowing access
to VISA devices from asyn, it is similar in functionality and usage to drvAsynSerialPortConfigure().
You can use it to access devices such as the NI GPIB/ENET 100

Typically you would create an asyn port using drvAsynVISAPortConfigure() and then use EPICS Stream device to 
send commands and interpret results. See the @link st.cmd IOC startup file @endlink for example usage.

To add this into your program you need to:

<UL>
<LI> Add VISAdrv.dbd to your DBD file list
<LI> Add VISAdrv to your LIB list
<LI> include   visa_lib.mak    to set the system library paths
</UL>

Then to configure the driver in the IOC at boot time (see iocsBoot/iocVISAdrvtest/st.cmd) use a command like:
<PRE>
    # local serial port (NI MAX name)
    drvAsynVISAPortConfigure("L0", "ASRL5::INSTR")

    # local serial port (alias)
    drvAsynVISAPortConfigure("L0", "COM5")

    # GPIB device added to local device list 
    drvAsynVISAPortConfigure("L0", "GPIB0::3::INSTR")

    # Remote System: GPIB device added to remote PC and served from there using NI VISA Server 
    drvAsynVISAPortConfigure("L0", "visa://remotecomputer/GPIB0::3::INSTR")
</PRE>

where L0 is you asyn port name followed by the local or remote VISA name of your device (see NI Measurement and Automation explorer if you don't know the name)
