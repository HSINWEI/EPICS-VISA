VISAdrv is an <A HREF="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</A> support module allowing access
to VISA devices from asyn, it is similar in functionality ands usage to drvAsynSerialPortConfigure()

Typically you would create an asyn port using drvAsynVISAPortConfigure() and then use EPICS Stream device to 
send commands and interpret results. See the @link st.cmd IOC startup file @endlink for example usage.

To add this into your program you need to:

<UL>
<LI> Add VISAdrv.dbd to your DBD file list
<LI> Add VISAdrv to your LIB list
<LI> include   visa_lib.mak    to set the system library paths
